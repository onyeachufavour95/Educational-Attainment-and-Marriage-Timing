## SUMMARY


1. **Marital Population Distribution:** The study reveals that 15% of the population is married, with the majority being between ages 21-30 and 31-40, especially among Bachelor's degree holders.

2. **Age of Marriage and Education:** Individuals with Bachelor's degrees tend to marry more frequently within the 21-30 and 31-40 age groups, indicating a correlation between educational attainment and marriage timing.

3. **Satisfaction and Timing of Marriage:** Bachelor's degree holders generally express satisfaction with the timing of their marriage, particularly in the 31-40 age group.

4. **Influence of Education on Marriage Timing:** There's acknowledgment among single and married individuals of the impact of educational background on marriage timing, with varying degrees of agreement observed.

5. **Highest Number of Single and Married by State of Origin:** Certain states, like Anambra and Enugu, stand out with the highest numbers of single and married individuals, respectively.

6. **Societal/Cultural Expectations Influence on Marriage Timing:** Data suggests a strong acknowledgment of societal and cultural expectations influencing marriage timing, particularly among younger age groups.

7. **Correlation Analysis in Power BI:** Power BI analysis reveals a perfect positive linear relationship between educational level and the timing of marriage within each gender category.

8. **Interpretation of Correlation:** The correlation coefficient of 1.00 signifies that as educational level increases, the time of marriage also increases proportionally, indicating a consistent trend across genders.

- **Caution:** While correlation is observed, it does not imply causation, and other factors may contribute to the relationship between education and marriage timing.
